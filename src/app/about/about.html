    <p class="text-xl max-w-3xl">
      This project is a technological adventure inspired by the Rick and Morty universe, where the goal is to go beyond the conventional and challenge the limits of web development with Angular.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Why did you build this?</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The main challenge of this POC is to explore the combination of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Single-Page Application (SPA) in Angular, facing the challenge of achieving a smooth and fast experience both on the server and the client. This approach aims to demonstrate how Angular can adapt to different needs, optimizing performance, accessibility, and user experience, while experimenting with the integration of ZardUI and a simple, functional folder structure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The decision to address the hybrid SSR/SPA mode responds to the need to offer applications that load quickly, are SEO friendly, and maintain a dynamic experience. This POC is an opportunity to learn, make mistakes, and improve, laying the foundation for more ambitious and robust future projects.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-8">
      Throughout the development, best practices, clarity in code organization, and ease of maintenance are prioritized, without losing sight of the importance of experimenting and pushing the framework's boundaries.
